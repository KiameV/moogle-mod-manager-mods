	"Description": "**Time to finally play as Gau**\n\nThe full/extended rage description mod is now available! Thanks to @Silvris for updating [Magicite](https://github.com/Silvris/Magicite) to have partial TXT and CSV support, making this mod compatible with any other mod that modifies the same files (provided they make a magicite mod with partials as well). This means it is automatically compatible with the Controls Notification Removal mod. Also thanks to @muffaloman for finishing up the last 50 descriptions!\n\n**What this does:**\n- Provides extensive rage descriptions for every rage. Seriously everything you need to know is here. Maybe too much info.\n- Fixes the Magna Roader problem. Now you'll know which Magna Roader you are selecting.\n- Separate optional Alphabetical Order sort order thanks to @Landy\n\n**If the alphabetical sorting does not work**, you need to learn one more rage to make it work. Thanks to @rocket for finding this oddity with the game, and Silvris for finding a solution.",
